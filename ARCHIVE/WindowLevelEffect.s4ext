# One line stating what the module does
description Use this tool to change window/level of background/foreground volumes based on the intensity range of the selected rectangle. Normal mode: use primary mouse button to adjust window level. Depending on the selection, Foreground, Background or both layers are affected. Rectangle mode: Left Click and Drag: sweep out an outline that will draw when the button is released. The outline will define the rectangle for calculating the new window/level settings for the selected layers.
