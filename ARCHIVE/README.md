# ARCHIVE

The modules in this directory are not actively maintained. They
persist in this directory as a convenient marker for historical
documentation, and to provide a starting point if future
projects would like to resume development.

Removing unused modules from the primary directory reduces
burden on slicer developers.

A short list of reasons why a module may be placed into
the archive are as follows

- Project that originally funded the extension is now complete
- The extension has been superceeded with another, and is not recommended
- The extension has no development support, and no longer runs properly

# Optional extension documentation:

| Date       | Extension Name                | Deprecation reason  |
|------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| 2023-08-11 | mpReview                      | The extension is available again (it has been updated to use Segment Editor module instead of the removed Editor module). |
| 2023-07-13 | SegmentGeometry               | Extension was [renamed to SlicerBiomech](https://github.com/Slicer/ExtensionsIndex/commit/b72fefc948e9710af3c631acd42360699211f8e4)]. |
| 2022-03-29 | DeepInfer                     | Not updated for Python3. MONAILabel may be used instead. |
| 2022-03-26 | WASP                          | Extension was [not compatible with Python3](https://github.com/Tomnl/Slicer-Wasp/issues/2) and ITK watershed segmentation is already available in SegmentEditorExtraEffects extension (with the limtiation that it does not precompute multiple levels). |
| 2022-03-25 | LongitudinalPETCT             | Extension build was failing due to dependency on removed module (Annotations, Editor, Charts)(https://github.com/QIICR/LongitudinalPETCT/issues/17). |
| 2022-03-25 | MFSDA                         | Extension build was failing and [maintaners not responding](https://github.com/DCBIA-OrthoLab/MFSDA_Python/issues/26). |
| 2022-03-25 | ResampleDTIlogEuclidean       | Extension build was failing and [maintaners not merging the proposed fix](https://github.com/NIRALUser/ResampleDTIlogEuclidean/issues/4). |
