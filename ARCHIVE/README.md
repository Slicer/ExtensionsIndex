# ARCHIVE

The modules in this directory are not actively maintained. They
persist in this directory as a convenient marker for historical
documentation, and to provide a starting point if future
projects would like to resume development.

Removing unused modules from the primary directory reduces
burden on slicer developers.

A short list of reasons why a module may be placed into
the archive are as follows

- Project that originally funded the extension is now complete
- The extension has been superceeded with another, and is not recommended
- The extension has no development support, and no longer runs properly
