# One line stating what the module does
description This extension contains modules that enable rapid prototyping of applications for image-guided interventions. Intended users should have real-time imaging and/or tracking hardware (e.g. tracked ultrasound) connected to 3D Slicer through OpenIGTLink network. Specific modules allow patient registration to the navigation coordinate system in 3D Slicer, and real-time update of tracked models and images.
