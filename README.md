Slicer Extensions Index
=======================

Overview
--------

Think of the ExtensionsIndex as a repository containing a list of [extension description file][]s
(*.s4ext) used by the Slicer extensions build system to build, test, package and upload
extensions on an [extensions server][].

Once uploaded on an `extensions server`, within Slicer, extensions can be installed using the [extensions manager][].

A website referred to as the [extensions catalog][] provides Slicer users with a convenient way of finding and downloading extensions previously uploaded on the `extensions server`. The `extensions manager` in Slicer makes the catalog available directly in the application and allows extensions to be installed, updated, or uninstalled by a few clicks.

The following diagram depicts how `extensions catalog`, `extensions server`, [CDash][] and the
slicer factory interact.
