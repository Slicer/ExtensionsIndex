description This extension contains one module of the same name. Using placed fiducials, it allows users to compute 2D angles: Yaw, Pitch and Roll; and decompose the 3D distance into the three different components: R-L , A-P and S-I. It is possible to compute the middle point between two fiducials and export the values.
