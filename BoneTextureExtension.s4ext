# One line stating what the module does
description This extensions contain several modules that can be used to compute feature maps of N-Dimensional images using well-known texture analysis methods. Key Features: 8 coocurrence textural features: energy, entropy, correlation, inertia, cluster Shade... / 10 run length textural features: run length emphasis, grey level non uniformity, run length non uniformity, low grey level long run emphasis... / Input configurable parameters: locality of the texture, offset directions for co-ocurrence and run length computation, the number of bins for the intensity histograms, and the intensity range or the range of run lengths.
